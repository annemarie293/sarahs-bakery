# Sarah's Bakery

## Introduction to the project
Sarah recently lost her job due to the Covid-19 lockdown and has decided to take this as an opportunity to pursue her passion for baking into a career. She has been selling her baked goods at some local markets and created social media accounts to connect with her customers. She feels a website is now necessary to help grow her business, creating a branded image and attracting new customers. The website would provide a full list of all her available cakes and pastries, as well as information on which markets she will be selling at. She would use the website as a way to take custom orders and increase her sales.
